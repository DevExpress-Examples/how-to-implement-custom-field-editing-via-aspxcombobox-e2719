<h1>Developer Express Example<br />How to implement custom field editing via ASPxComboBox</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates how to use ASPxComboBox in case of a custom field editing on a custom appointment form. This control (ID="edtField1") is defined in the ~/CustomSchedulerForms/CustomAppointmentForm.ascx markup. The actual databinding (with a lookup logic) is handled in its Init event. The selected value is transfered back to the controller in the CustomAppointmentSaveCallbackCommand.AssignControllerValues method.
This example also illustrates how you can implement and use the IsAppointmentChanged method within your custom AppointmentFormSaveCallbackCommand descendant. The AppointmentFormSaveCallbackCommand.CanContinueExecute method is overridden so that the end-user should change the appointment's <i>Price </i>field to save an appointment. Otherwise any changes are not saved.
Prior to running this example, create a CarsXtraScheduling database on your local SQL Server instance. The database script is attached to the project (<i>CarsXtraScheduling.sql</i> file). You should modify the script to include the correct database path.
